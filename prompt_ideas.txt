1. Revised Early Game Advice Prompt (Append to System Prompt)
Your immediate focus upon starting a new Warsim game is Phase 1: Initial Assessment and Setup. Begin by addressing all petitioners in the Throne Room; consider using the filtering options if the initial number is overwhelming, but see everyone first to maximize potential gains like free troops or quests. Next, access the Diplomacy screen to gain a clear overview of surrounding factions and their current stance towards you – identify immediate threats and potential neutral parties. Check the Royal Bank for any starting bonus gold and withdraw it. Then, proceed to the Kingdom Laws screen. Critically, set your recruitment policy to 'Forceful Enlistment' to prioritize income-generating peasants early on, and decide whether to enable or disable peasant-to-soldier training based on your immediate economic needs (disabling it helps income). Review and enable basic taxes like the Banking Tax and Land Tax.
With the initial assessment complete, transition to Phase 2: Preparation and Resource Gathering. Examine your Staff screen, paying close attention to your starting Diplomat's skill level. A weak diplomat severely limits options; prioritize hiring a more competent replacement if one is available and affordable, or make plans to train them if that feature is accessible. Focus on boosting your treasury and basic troop numbers using your initial funds and any gains from the Throne Room or bank. If the Goblin Slaver is present and deemed useful (consider the pros and cons), acquiring cheap goblins can supplement your peasant base handled by Auto-Recruitment. If funds remain critically low after these steps, cautiously consider using the Arena for betting, but be aware of the inherent risks.
Finally, prepare for Phase 3: Action and End-of-Turn Procedures. Use your exploration chances to discover the realm, potentially finding more resources or triggering events. Review your diplomatic options again now that you have a better sense of your resources and potentially an improved diplomat – perhaps attempt contact with neutral factions for trade. Consider if any immediate, low-risk military action (like a raid for gold or attacking a very weak isolated target) is feasible, but avoid overextending early. Before concluding the turn, the most critical step is to visit the Royal Bank and deposit the vast majority of your gold to protect it from potential raids. Only after this security measure should you proceed to the End Turn screen to consider launching any planned military actions.
2. Revised Basics of the Game Prompt (Provide as Foundational Knowledge)
Warsim is a text-based kingdom management simulation where you, as the ruler, make decisions via menus impacting your Gold, Land, Troops, and Public Opinion. Core activities involve interacting with subjects in the Throne Room, managing foreign relations through Diplomacy, hiring specialized Staff (Diplomats, Generals, etc.), setting Kingdom Laws (affecting taxes, recruitment, etc.), funding Kingdom Upgrades, discovering the world through Exploration, managing finances via the Royal Bank (including deposits, interest, and loans), and potentially engaging with the Arena for gambling or entertainment. Mercenaries offer additional military options. Auto-Recruitment is active, automatically managing baseline numbers for militia peasants, knights (within hireable limits), bandits, slaves, and goblins gained from events or conquest. This frees you to focus on strategic choices: high-level diplomacy, staff selection, mercenary contracts, law optimization, targeted upgrades, exploration strategy, bank management, and planning end-of-year military campaigns (Raids, Skirmishes, Invasions). The game progresses in yearly turns, concluding with your optional military actions followed by enemy actions and reports.
3. Revised Strategic Goal-Oriented Overview Prompt (Use at Summarization Intervals)
At this summarization interval, critically evaluate your kingdom's standing and progress, considering the typical objectives achieved after the initial setup phases in Warsim. Review the effectiveness of your early economic stabilization efforts: is income reliable, have foundational laws been optimized, and is wealth consistently secured in the bank? Assess the outcomes of your initial diplomatic assessments and actions: are borders relatively secure through peace or deterrence, have key threats been identified and managed, and are potentially beneficial relationships being cultivated? Evaluate your military strength in relation to these threats, considering the foundation laid by Auto-Recruitment and any successful early troop-boosting efforts or mercenary interventions. Reflect on the quality of your core staff, particularly the Diplomat and Spymaster – have necessary upgrades been made? Consider your territorial position – have you secured enough land for basic security without provoking excessive hostility? Based on this evaluation of how well the initial goals of assessment, preparation, and early action were met, formulate refined strategic priorities for the next phase, focusing on consolidating gains, addressing remaining weaknesses, and pursuing mid-term objectives like targeted expansion or deeper economic development.
4. Revised Yearly Checklist Prompt (Use Each Turn/Year)
Each year presents a cycle of opportunities and challenges. To ensure consistent management, follow this core checklist before ending your turn. First, check the Throne Room for any new petitioners and address their requests or concerns. Second, review your Diplomatic situation: check relations with key factions, monitor ongoing threats, and consider potential diplomatic actions like trade offers or managing vassals. Third, assess your Staff and Military needs: evaluate staff effectiveness, consider hiring/firing, and determine if Mercenaries are required for upcoming objectives or defense. Fourth, utilize all Exploration chances to continue revealing the map and encountering events. Fifth, consider Economic actions: review Kingdom Upgrade options for potential investment and manage your Royal Bank funds (considering withdrawals for spending or loans if necessary). Sixth, plan End-of-Year Military Actions: decide if launching an Invasion, Raid, or Skirmish against specific targets aligns with your current strategy and resources. Finally, and most critically, before proceeding to the End Turn screen where you launch attacks, visit the Royal Bank and deposit the majority of your liquid gold to protect it from loss during the turn resolution. Completing this cycle consistently forms the backbone of successful long-term kingdom management in Warsim.
